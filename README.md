# Expense Tracker App made in Rails + Inertia JS + React

## About

The application was developed as a final project for the Altcademy Fullstack Development Program. The project requirements was a full-stack application that demonstrates comprehensive web development skills. I chose to build an expense tracker becazse it's a practical tool that I could use in my daily life, and its scope was well-suited for the timeline.


For the backend, I selected Ruby on Rails, a framework we worked with during the program. I also think Rails' convention-over-configuration philosophy and robust ecosystem made a good choice for this type of application. On the frontend, I wanted to work with React and choose to do it Inertia.js, which I have read about but never worked with before.

The application currently implements all core features of an expense tracker but there's also a lof of potential for improvements. Planned improvements include advanced analytics, budget forecasting and receipt scanning.

## Features

- **Expense Tracking**: Log and categorize your daily expenses
- **Budget Management**: Set and monitor monthly spending limits
- **Categorization**: Automatically organize expenses with tags
- **Date Filtering**: View expenses by different time periods
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with rails

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails
- **Frontend**: React with Inertia.js
